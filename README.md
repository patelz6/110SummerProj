# SCC110
Repository for SCC.110 summer term project

My game is the Air Hockey (project option 2) game that works with the latest version of GameArena and it's associated classes. It has the capability of playing the game with accurate collisions and noises, has built-in cheat codes and also has replayability through the main game loop. 

HOW TO RUN:
The main way to run is simply pressing f5 once you have downloaded the folder and opened it. The main window will pop-up with sound pre-enabled. This can be toggled on and off by pressing ENTER for on and SHIFT for off. The status of the sound being on or off is indicated by the colour of the sound text (red - off / green - on). The controls are WASD for player 1 (The player on the left side) and arrow keys for player 2 (The player one the right side). Cheat codes are indicated in a similar fashion, with text at the top, and are used by pressing either 'O' or 'P' for player 1 and 2 respectively. Sound is handled by using 'Runnable' and running the class logic through a seperate thread to prevent the main game logic from lagging.
